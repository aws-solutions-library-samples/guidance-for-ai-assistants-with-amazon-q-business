## Overview (required)

This guidance aims to showcase how to build an end-to-end business application using Amazon Q, a conversational AI assistant, along with AWS services like CloudFormation, DynamoDB, and Lambda. It demonstrates the integration of Amazon Q to retrieve relevant information, pass it to a language model, and return a response. The guidance also uses Infrastructure as Code to manage the application's resources and includes a sample HR time-off request application built using the Amazon Q custom plugin. The key objective is to provide a blueprint for developers to build conversational AI-powered business applications, leveraging the capabilities of Amazon Q and the AWS ecosystem.

## Deployment Steps (required)
**Step 01**
Clone the repository ```git clone <this repo name>

**Step 02**

cd deployment/publishAssets

chmod +x ./publish_assets.sh

./publish_Amazon_OpenSearch.sh


 
**Example:**

1. Clone the repo using command ```git clone xxxxxxxxxx```

3. Install packages in requirements using command ```pip install requirement.txt```
4. Edit content of **file-name** and replace **s3-bucket** with the bucket name in your account.
5. Run this command to deploy the stack ```cdk deploy``` 
6. Capture the domain name created by running this CLI command ```aws apigateway ............```



## Deployment Validation  (required)

<Provide steps to validate a successful deployment, such as terminal output, verifying that the resource is created, status of the CloudFormation template, etc.>


**Examples:**

* Open CloudFormation console and verify the status of the template with the name starting with xxxxxx.
* If deployment is successful, you should see an active database instance with the name starting with <xxxxx> in        the RDS console.
*  Run the following CLI command to validate the deployment: ```aws cloudformation describe xxxxxxxxxxxxx```



## Running the Guidance (required)

<Provide instructions to run the Guidance with the sample data or input provided, and interpret the output received.> 

This section should include:

* Guidance inputs
* Commands to run
* Expected output (provide screenshot if possible)
* Output description



## Next Steps (required)

Provide suggestions and recommendations about how customers can modify the parameters and the components of the Guidance to further enhance it according to their requirements.
